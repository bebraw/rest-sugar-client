# rest-sugar-client - Makes it easy to write yummy clients for rest-sugar APIs

rest-sugar-client complements [rest-sugar](https://github.com/bebraw/rest-sugar).
It provides a simple way to write client side code based on rest-sugar's
introspection functionality. It uses that information and provides an API that
you may use to poke the server.
